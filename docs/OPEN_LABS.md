# Environmental Open Labs

Environmental Open Labs is the Open Data platform created for the Spanish Province of Badajoz to host any kind of environmental-related information, including IoT readings comming from [RESPIRA stations](RESPIRA_STATION.md), official [AEMET](http://www.aemet.es/en/portada) stations and the [Copernicus Athmospheric Monitoring Service](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/).

Anyone from the community can upload relevant information about the environment in our region or transmit IoT information to the platform from commercial or DIY sensing devices. The aim of this project is then:

- Provide a creative tool for Badajoz to upload, share and manage useful environmental information.
- Public deployment of low-cost IoT devices for air and water monitoring purposes.
- Creation of a dynamic community of users interested in the IoT and the environment
- Promote the green culture in Badajoz
- Showcase [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/) and the Open Source culture as a way to build useful solutions for the cities.
