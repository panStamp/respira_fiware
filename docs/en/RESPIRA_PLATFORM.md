# Environmental Open Labs

Environmental Open Labs is the Open IoT platform created for the Spanish Province of Badajoz to host any kind of environmental-related IoT information, including readings comming from [RESPIRA stations](RESPIRA_STATION.md), official [AEMET](http://www.aemet.es/en/portada) stations and the [Copernicus Athmospheric Monitoring Service](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/).

Anyone from the community can upload relevant information about the environment in our region or transmit IoT information to the platform from commercial or DIY sensing devices. The aim of this project is then:

- Provide a creative tool for Badajoz to upload, share and manage useful environmental IoT information.
- Public deployment of low-cost IoT devices for air and water monitoring purposes.
- Creation of a dynamic community of users interested in the IoT and the environment
- Promote the green culture in Badajoz
- Showcase [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/) and the Open Source culture as a way to build useful solutions for the cities.

Environmental Open Labs is entirely powered by FIWARE. Communication from IoT devices to the platform is done via [UltraLight 2.0 HTTP]((https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html)). UltraLight is a lightweight IoT protocol specially created for constrained IoT hardware platforms such as Arduinos, ESP8266 and other low-power microcontrollers.

[This guide](HOWTO_RESPIRA_PLATFORM.md) shows how to use _Environmental Open Labs_ and start sending data from your IoT device.
