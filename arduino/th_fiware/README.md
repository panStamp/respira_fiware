# Basic FIWARE temperature and humidity sensor

This is a basic example showing how to connect a temperature and humidity sensor to our RESPIRA open platform via FIWARE UltraLight. The source code is ready to upload to a ESP8266 SoC from an Arduino IDE. The sensor is a SI7021 dual temperature and humidity sensor supporting I2C communications.
