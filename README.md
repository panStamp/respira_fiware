# Open FIWARE air monitoring platform for urban applications

RESPIRA FIWARE is an open source air monitoring device created to sense temperature, humidity, particle matter and NO2 levels in the air. This device transmits levels and concentrations to a central FIWARE platform and has been originally created to connect and transmit against the RESPIRA Environmental IoT platform of Badajoz. Both projects have been developped by [panStamp](http://www.panstamp.com) and sponsored by [Diputación de Badajoz](https://www.dip-badajoz.es/) and [Telefónica](https://www.telefonica.com/en/)
